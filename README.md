# Two Hour Coding Challenge - Angular

## Challenge

Build a web app that displays images taken by NASA's Mars rovers, Opportunity and Curiosity.

## Instructions

* Use the API key `Jpz1UkzkRxdxrg9Xg69mJSleGt5HCbQzqXWUrlFR` to get rover image data from NASA's [Mars Rover Photos API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos).

* Develop a UI based on the included [wireframes](/wires) and user stories. You can use any libraries and/or frameworks you like. If a story lacks detail, use your best judgement.

* Document the build and installation processes.

* Work on a branch.

* At the end of **2 hours** push your branch to the repo and then **merge it to master via a merge request**.

## User Stories

* As a user, when the page loads, I can see the 'Image of the Day', a random image selected from those taken yesterday by either rover.

* As a user, I can navigate to a gallery displaying images taken yesterday by either rover.

* As a user, I can filter the images by camera name.

* As a user, I want to see dates formatted in the style `Month dd, yyyy`.

* As a user, I want the app to be responsive.

* **STRETCH**: As a user, I can specify the earth date for which to display images.

# Installation / Usage

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
